# Graph Explorer demo repository
Repository containing demos for the [Graph Explorer](https://github.com/vaadin/Graph-Explorer) add-on for 
[Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/).

The only functional demo is currently the Neo4J demo. To build it, you will need 
[Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), the [Vaadin plug-in](http://vaadin.com/eclipse) (to compile the
widgetset) and the [IvyDE plug-in](http://ant.apache.org/ivy/ivyde/) (to resolve the dependencies). You will also need to
supply your own Neo4J 1.3.M03 graph DB at `<user.home>/graphdb`.

If anyone wants to fork the Neo4J demo and upgrade it to a newer version of Neo4J, please be my guest and send me a pull 
request! :)
